# Object Inheritance Lab Part Two

## Learning Goals

- Reduce repeated code and enhance objects using inheritance.
  - Define two classes, one of which inherits from another.
  - Define methods in the child class that use the `super` keyword to inherit
    from and augment methods in the parent class.
- Accomplish complex programming tasks using knowledge from previous modules.

## Key Vocab

- **Inheritance**: a tool that allows us to recycle code by creating a class
that "inherits" the attributes and methods of a parent class.
- **Composition**: a tool that enables you to recycle code by adding objects to
other objects. Rather than building on a base class as in inheritance,
composition leverages the attributes and methods of an instance of another class.
- **Subclass**: a class that inherits from another class. Colloquially called
a "child" class.
- **Superclass**: a class that is inherited by another class. Colloquially
called a "parent" class.
- **Child**: another name for a subclass.
- **Parent**: another name for a superclass.
- **`super()`**: a built-in Python function that allows us to manipulate the
attributes and methods of a superclass from the body of its subclass.
- **Decorator**: syntax that allows us to add functionality to an object
without modifying its structure.

## Instructions

In this lab, you'll be coding a `Student` class, which will be the superclass,
and a `ChattyStudent` class, which will inherit from `Student`.

`ChattyStudent` _is_ a student, so they should have all of the behaviors and
characteristics of a student. The difference is that `ChattyStudent` is _very
chatty_. So, they will elaborate on any phrases that are inherited from
`Student`.

Run the test suite to get started. This is a test-driven lab.

1. Write a method in the `Student` class, `hello()`, that `print()`s out the
   phrase:

   > _"Hey there! I'm so excited to learn stuff."_

2. Write a method in the `Student` class, `raise_hand()`, that `print()`s out
   the phrase:

   > _"Pick me!"_

3. Write a method in the `ChattyStudent` class, `hello()`, that uses `super()`
   to inherit the behavior of the `hello()` method from the parent class. Then,
   augment that method to also `print()` out the very chatty phrase:

   > _"How are you doing today? I'm okay, but I'm kind of tired. Did you watch
   > The Walking Dead last night? You didn't?! Oh man, it was so crazy! What,
   > you don't want any spoilers? Okay well let me just tell you who died..."_

4. Write a method in the `ChattyStudent` class, `raise_hand()`, that uses
   `super()` ten times so that the method will `print()` out _"Pick me!"_ ten
   times. **It is possible to call `super()` multiple times in a method.**
